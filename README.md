# SquareDB
The idea behind this was to create a new database, focusing on the data structures and algorithms behind it.

I am also really interested in learning Rust, and this was a way for me to learn it.

I made a really good note-taking system for this, which I will probably reuse.

<summary>My note-taking system</summary>

- For markdown notes I use [Vimwiki](https://vimwiki.github.io/vimwikiwiki)
- For a kanban board I use [Nullboard](https://nullboard.io/preview)
- For whiteboards I use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)
- For diagrams I use [Nomnoml](https://nomnoml.com)

## Roadmap
- [X] Create structures to store the database in-memory.
- [X] Implement RocksDb.
- [X] Implement a server with Axum.
