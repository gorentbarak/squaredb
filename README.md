# SquareDB
The idea behind this was to create a new database, focusing on the data structures and algorithms behind it.

I am also really interested in learning Rust, and this was a way for me to learn it.

I came up with a really-good note-taking system for this, which I think I'm going to reuse, because it helped make me *way* more productive.

It's currently really bad, and will have to go through some *very* harsh refactoring.
