Hi! I just released SquareDB. I made it to better learn Rust, but I think I'm going to keep maintaining and optimizing it. I think it needs some performance optimization, and general code quality improvements. If you can, please help document it, as that is really needed. It is really a simple database so far. It really isn't much yet, but I'm still actively working on it.
It's currently really simple, just five files. I'm really excited to make this. Learning Rust has been a lot of fun, and I genuinely love the language. It has a beautiful syntax, but it's also extremely practical. Rust genuinely excited me. Anyways, start it on GitHub, and tell me what you think!
